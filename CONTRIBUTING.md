# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the Achievement Watcher Team before making a change. 

Please note we have some [legal](https://github.com/msolefonte/celes#legal-aspects) aspects to cover, so follow them in 
all your interactions with the project. If you add a pull request, you are responsible of the content.

## Pull Request Process

1. Open an issue with the change you are willing to do. Ensure that the Team is aware and that the fix or feature
   is expected and desired.
1. Create a fork and work over the most updated `beta/*` branch. You can create a Work In Progress pull request if
   desired or wait for everything to be complete to do it. That's up to you.
1. Once ready, ensure that you have not left any development dependency in, that your code passes the tests and that you
   have updated the docs if required. Create the pull request, if not yet created, and wait for review.
1. After reviewing the pull request, the team member is going to leave some comments left or to accept it. If valid, it 
   is going to get mergeded into the beta branch, waiting for proper testing and for a new release.
1. Be proud! You have contributed to an Open Source project. That's cool!
